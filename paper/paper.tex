\title{Approximately Euclidean Grids}
\author{Moshe Looks}

\maketitle

The distance $d_G(u, v)$ between vertices in an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ is the number
of edges in a shortest path between $u$ and $v$. The distance $d_2(p, q)$ between points
Euclidean space is the $2$-norm of the line segment between $u$ and $v$. In two or more
dimensions, no injective mapping $f : V \to \mathbb{N}^2$ can satisfy $d_G(u, v) = d_2(f(u),
f(v))$ because of the incommensurability of the side and diagonal of the square. Nonetheless,
$d_G(u, v)$ can be used to approximate $d_2(f(u), f(v))$; the approximation will be better or
worse depending on our choices of $G$ and $f$. How well can $d_G$ approximate $d_2$, assuming
$|V| = N$?

This is an interesting question, but difficult to answer in full generality. Let's consider
the special case of a graph with $N = n^2$ vertices, arranged in a square grid to correspond
to the points $\{1, \ldots, n\} \times \{1, \ldots, n\}$. If we add edges between horizontal
and vertical neighbors, we get Manhattan distances ($d_1$, based on the $1$-norm). If we
additionally add edges between diagonal neighbors,\footnote{Without loss of generality, we
only consider diagonals corresponding to line segments of the form $\{p + (\Delta, \Delta) \,
| \, 0 \leq \Delta \leq 1\}$, and distances between vertices placed at pairs of points of the
form $(p, p + \Delta) \, | \, p, \Delta _\in \mathbb{N}^2$.} then we get chessboard distances
($d_\infty$, based on the $\infty$-norm).

We have the nice property that $d_1(p, q) \leq d_2(p, q) \leq d_\infty(p, q)$, but
nonetheless, neither one of these constructs gives us a very good approximation of
$d_2$. Indeed, it is easy to see that the divergences from $d_2$ grow unboundedly with $n$.
In fact, Tobias Fritz has \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1963}{proven} that this divergence
happens for \emph{every} distance function based on periodic graph. But nothing prevents us
from considering aperiodic graphs. What happens if we start with a graph corresponding to
$d_1$ and we add edges between only \emph{some} diagonal neighbors?

\section{An overly simplistic approach}

In the spirit of trying simple things first, lets see what happens if we take a greedy
approach and only consider distance to $\mathbf{1} = (1, 1)$. It can be easily seen that
if there is an edge between the vertices corresponding to points $(i, j)$ and $(i + 1, j+1)$
then
\begin{equation}
  d_G(\mathbf{1}, (i+1, j+1)) = 1 + d_G(\mathbf{1}, (i, j))
\end{equation}
and that otherwise
\begin{equation}
  d_G(\mathbf{1}, (i+1, j+1)) = 1 + \min(d_G(\mathbf{1}, (i + 1, j)),
                                         d_G(\mathbf{1}, (i, j + 1)))
\end{equation}

This suggests simply


This approach gives us very nice circular arcs around $\mathbf{1}$

But very ugly circular arcs around other vertices.

We can generalize this approach and consider distances to all $\mathbf{1}$ but also

for example:

This graph has an interesting property; for every Pythagorean triple\footnote{Triples of
natural numbers $(a, b, c)$ s.t. $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$; eg. $(3, 4, 5)$, $(12, 5, 13)$, \&c.}
$(a, b, c)$ and every pair of vertices $(p, q)$ corresponding respectively to $(x, y)$ and
$(x + a, y + b)$, $d(p, q) = c$. Let's call an undirected graph with $|V| = n^2$ that has
this property an order-$n$ Eugrid (Euclidean grid).

Pythagorean triples are dense in the rational numbers. Consequently, a Eugrid of sufficiently
high order would, in a certain sense, perfectly reflect the structure of Euclidean space, insofar as
it is \emph{can} be reflected by a finite square grid. But do high-order Eugrids
exist?\footnote{Spoiler: they do not.}

\section{Answering the Question}

We can construct a state space to search for order-$n$ Eugrids by putting undirected graphs
in correspondence with $(n - 1) \times (n - 1)$ bit matrices where $1$s correspond to the
presence of edges between diagonal neighbors.\footnote{Eugrids include all edges between
horizontal and vertical neighbors, by definition.} For example, the order-$5$ Eugrid
exhibited above corresponds to a $4 x 4$ Eugridean matrix:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{matrix}
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{matrix}
\end{equation*}

The state space for order $n$ has $2^{(n-1)^2}$ elements. For $n=5$ this is only 65,536 and
we can brute-force it to see that there are 10,948 order-$5$ Eugrids; they are rather thick
on the ground. What to do about higher orders where exponential growth makes things
unpleasant? We can make some headway by noticing that higher-order Eugrids must be composed
of lower-order ones. In particular, if matrix $\mathbf{A}$ corresponds to an order-$n$
Eugrid, then all submatrices $\mathbf{A}_{1:m,1:m}$ correspond to order-$m$ Eugrids.

This naturally suggests a partition of the full $(n-1)^2$-dimensional state space into
$(n-1)$ disjoint ``layers'', like so:

\begin{center}
  \input{onion.tex}
\end{center}

Possible diagonals for the $m$th layer correspond to squares numbered $m$. So rather than
constructing an entire state in one go, we only ever construct substates corresponding to
individual layers. When constructing a substate corresponding to layer $m+1$, we can assume
that all substates corresponding to layers $1 \ldots m$ are valid (i.e. correspond to
lower-order Eugrids). We may have to backtrack of course; some lower-order Eugrids are dead
ends.

This is a good start towards tractability but is insufficient; the state subspace for layer
$m$ still has $2^{2m-1}$ elements. What we need is a more intelligent search pro

We have more work to do in order to make the search tractable. The first step is to move away
from brute-force enumeration when considering diagonals for layer $n+1$ given layer $n$
already contains a Eugrid.\footnote{The $n=0$ case corresponds to a layer only a single
search space variable, so we don't mind enumerating over it.} The basic idea here is that
every region of the space corresponding to a Pythagorean triple $(a, b, c)$ with lower-left
corner $(x, y)$ corresponds to a set of constraints on the diagonals inside of it, and we
will end up with a Eugrid iff \emph{all} such sets of constraints are satisfied.

What are these constraints, exactly? If all variables corresponding to diagonals in a
particular region have been assigned, then obviously the constraints require the shortest
paths from $(x, y)$ to $(x+a, y+b)$ have length $c$. But we can do better than this and
impose constraints on partially assigned regions as well. For example, no Eugridean matrix
can contain
\begin{equation*}
\begin{matrix}
  1 & * & * \\
  * & 1 & * \\
  * & * & 1
\end{matrix}
\end{equation*}
as a proper submatrix (where ``*'' may be either a 1 or a 0) because if so then it would be
contained within a $3x4$ region\footnote{Corresponding to the Pythagorean triple $(3, 4,
5)$.} with a shortest path for the hypotenuse of length $< 5$ in violation of Eugrideanity.
Likewise $0_{2 x 4}$ is not a submatrix of any Eugridean, because it would lead to a similar
region with hypotenuse of length $> 5$.

Since graph distance equals shortest path length, $d(u, v) = c$ requires both that no path
from $u$ to $v$ be shorter than $c$, \emph{and} that at least one path be no longer than $c$.
The partition of a square grid into layers as we have done dictates that all shortest pathsbetween.

To get tight bounds, recall that Eugridean distance is lower-bounded by $L_\infty$ and
upper-bounded by $L_1$.

For every literal \verb|x| and corresponding vertex $x$, \emph{if} there exists a region
$r = (p, q, c)$ s.t. $d(p, x) + d_1(x, q) == c$, \emph{then} $r$ is unconstrained \emph{and}
\verb|x| is negated.

For every region $r = (p, q, c)$, \emph{if} there exists a vertex $x$ s.t.
$d(p, x) + d_{\infty}(x, q) < c$, \emph{then} $r$ is unconstrained.

All other regions are constrained. For every constrained region $r = (p, q, c)$ at least one
literal \verb|x| corresponding to vertex $x$ that satisfies $d(p, x) + d_{\infty}(x, q) = c$
must be affirmed.

We can thus construct a logical conjunction of clauses where every clauses is either a
negated literal or a disjunction of non-negated literals s.t. the layer is valid iff the the
conjunction is satisfied. Whereas general Boolean satisfiability is a hard problem, formulae
with this special form are easily checkable. We can easily enumerate all valid assignments
using depth-first search.

This leads to a backtracking search procedure for finding Eugrids:

Let $1$ be the active layer.

Generate a satisfying assignment for the active layer. If no satisfying assignment exist, or
if we have already generated all satisfying assignments, backtrack to the previous layer.

Advance to the next layer.
