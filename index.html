    Imagine a digital universe where points in space are vertices in a graph, and the
    distance between two points is the length of a shortest path between them. Can the graph
    be structured whereby macroscopic observers living in the universe perceive isotropic
    space, as we perceive in our universe?

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The distance \(d_G(u, v)\) between vertices in an undirected graph \(G = (V, E)\) is the
    number of edges in a shortest path between \(u\) and \(v\). The distance \(d_2(u, v)\)
    between points on the Euclidean plane is the \(2\)-norm of the line segment between \(u\)
    and \(v\). Non-degenerate \(V \subset \mathbb{N}^2\) cannot satisfy \(d_G = d_2\) because
    of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2">incommensurability</a> of
    the side and the diagonal of a square. Nonetheless, \(d_G\) can be used to approximate
    \(d_2\); the approximation will be better or worse as a function of \(G\). How well can
    \(d_G\) approximate \(d_2\), as \(|V|\) grows?
  </p>

  <p>
    This question is difficult to answer in full generality. Let's consider the special case
    of a graph whose vertices are the square grid \(\{1, \ldots, n\} \times \{1, \ldots,
    n\}\). If we add edges between horizontal and vertical neighbors, we get \(d_1\)
    taxicab distances, based on the \(1\)-norm. If we additionally add edges between
    diagonal neighbors, then we get \(d_\infty\) chessboard distances, based on the
    \(\infty\)-norm.

  <p>
    We have the nice property that \(d_1 \leq d_2 \leq d_\infty\), although neither one of
    these constructs gives us a very good approximation of \(d_2\). It is easy to see that in
    both cases, the divergences from \(d_2\) grow unboundedly with \(n\).  In fact,
    Fritz<d-cite key="Fritz_2013"></d-cite> has proven that this divergence happens
    for <i>every</i> distance function based on a periodic graph. But nothing prevents us
    from considering aperiodic graphs. What happens if we start with a graph corresponding to
    \(d_1\) and we add edges between only <i>some</i> diagonal neighbors?  Let's call this
    sort of graph, where \(d_G\) is meant to approximate \(d_2\), an
    order-\(n\) <i>Eugrid</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Certain formal properties of Eugrids are worth calling out at this point to avoid
    confusion. All order-\(n\) Eugrids share the same square grid of vertices depicted
    above. Edges corresponding to line segments of unit length are present in all Eugrids.
    Eugrids vary in the presence or absence of edges corresponding to line segments of length
    \(\sqrt{2}\). Edges corresponding to line segements of other lengths <i>never</i> appear.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is notationally convenient <d-footnote>This representation ignores graph symmetries
    and is thus inappropriate for combinatoric calculations.</d-footnote> to represent
    order-\(n\) Eugrids by pairs of square bit matrices of order \(n-1\), which we refer to
    as the diagonals and antidiagonals, respectively. Diagonals are edges corresponding to
    line segments paralleling \(x=y\). Antidiagonals run cross-wise, paralleling \(x=-y\).
  </p>

  <h2>Eugrid Construction Heuristics</h2>

  <p>
    Let us consider for the moment only distances from the corner vertex \(\mathbf{1} := (1,
    1)\) to other points. This lets us ignore the antidiagonals, which do not affect
    distances between \(\mathbf{1}\) and other points, simplifying notation, discussion, and
    visualization.
  </p>

  <p>
    A very simple way to interpolate between taxicab and chessboard distances is to decide
    on the presence or absence of each diagonal edge by sampling a random variate from a
    Bernoulli distribution.

  <p>
    This initially seems promising. If we drill down a bit we find that the best
    fit <d-footnote>Determined by Hamming distance from an ideal circular arc.</d-footnote>
    is obtained around \(p = 0.17\).

  </figure>

  <p>
    The arc in the figure on the left above looks decently circular away from the axes, but
    near the axes themselves there are straight lines, corresponding to a rather high degree
    of anisotropy. As the figure on the right above shows, this anisotropy does not diminish
    as the measurement scale increases <d-footnote>Diminishing anisotropy with measurement
    scale would manifest as sublinear growth in the width of the black region of the figure,
    moving downwards.</d-footnote> but remains more-or-less constant, and hence detectable by
    a macroscopic observer.
  </p>

  <p>
    This informal analysis suffices to demonstrate that Eugrids based on random Bernoulli
    variates are poor models of the Euclidean plane. It is nonetheles encouraging to see that
    such a simple procedure can yield reasonably circular arcs, at least away from the axes.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to devise better heuristics we must take a look at Eugrid microstructure. Let
    \((x_v, y_v)\) be the Cartesian coordinates of vertex \(v\). Assuming \(x_u \leq x_v\) and
    \(y_u \leq x_v\), <d-footnote>This is always the case when \(u = \mathbf{1}\).</d-footnote>

    $$\mathbb{D}_1(u, v) := 1 + d_G(u, v)$$

    is the graph distance between \(u\) and \(v + \mathbf{1}\) when the diagonal at
    \(v\) <d-footnote>This is the edge between \(v\) and \(v + \mathbf{1}\).</d-footnote> is
    present in the graph, and

    $$\mathbb{D}_2(u, v) := 1 + \min(d_G(u, (x_v + 1, y_v)), d_G(u, (x_v, y_v + 1)))$$

    is the distance when the diagonal at \(v\) is absent. Let us further define

    $$L^u_i(v) := |d_2(u, v + \mathbf{1}) - \mathbb{D}_i(u, v)|.$$

    \(L^u_1(v)\) is the loss (i.e. deviation from Euclidean distance) from \(u\) when the
    diagonal at \(v\) is present, and \(L^u_2(v)\) is the loss from \(u\) when the diagonal
    at \(v\) is absent. For example,

    $$L^\mathbf{1}_i(v) = |\sqrt{x_v^2 + y_v^2} - \mathbb{D}_i(\mathbf{1}, v)|.$$
  </p>

  <h3>The \(\mathbf{1}\)-growth heuristic</h3>

  <p>
    A simple greedy approach to constructing Eugrids is to visit each potential diagonal at
    \(v\) exactly once <d-footnote>Taking care to visit the diagonal at \((x+1, y+1)\) after
    we have visited the diagonals at \((x+1,y)\) and \((x,y+1)\).</d-footnote>  and decide
    whether or not to add it to the graph based on whether \(L^\mathbf{1}_1(v)\) or
    \(L^\mathbf{1}_2(v)\) is smaller <d-footnote>When the two quantities are equal we add the
    diagonal, based on the results of some preliminary ad hoc experiments.</d-footnote>. We
    refer to this approach as the \(\mathbf{1}\)-growth heuristic.
  </p>

      where \(L_1 = L_2\).
      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    \(\mathbf{1}\)-growth is a completely deterministic procedure, but the graph structure that it
    produces is aperiodic, so Fritz&apos;s no-go theorem does not apply; arcs around
    \(\mathbf{1}\) become increasingly circular as the radius increases.

  </figure>

  <p>
    This demonstrates that the Eugrid representation can give us a very nice model of the
    Euclidean plane, with minimal anisotropy, at least from a single perspective. The moment
    we shift our perspective however, things begin to seem rather worse.

    </figure>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Even worse than in the case of Bernoulli random variates, we see severe anisotropy around
    the axes; back to the drawing board!
  </p>

  <h3>The \(\Gamma\)-growth heuristic</h3>

  <p>
    How can we make better Eugrids? We can generalize the \(\mathbf{1}\)-growth heuristic and
    consider losses from more vertices than just \(\mathbf{1}\). What is left is to
    specify <i>which</i> vertices, and how to weight their relative contributions, since
    adding a particular diagonal edge may make some distances more Euclidean, and other less
    so.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the diagonal at \(v\), we can potentially calculate losses from all vertices \(u\)
    such that \(x_u \leq x_v\) and \(y_u \leq y_v\). But since this both highly redundant and
    scales badly with \(n\), we restrict ourselves to vertices along the left and upper edges
    of the Eugrid, i.e.

    $$\Gamma_v := \{u \mid x_u \leq x_v \land y_u \leq y_v \land \min(x_u, y_u) = 1\}.$$

    We refer to this approach as the \(\Gamma\)-growth heuristic, and the resulting graphs as
    \(\Gamma\)-Eugrids.
  </p>

  <figure class="l-body" style="margin-left: 15%;">
    <img alt="Gamma distances" src="figures/gamma.svg" style="width: 70%;">
    <figcaption>

      \(v = (5, 5)\).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This gives us nice coverage and is computationally tractable, but requires careful
    normalization to balance relative contributions. In particular, we include two factors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first factor weights the contribution of vertex \(u\) by the angle \(\theta^u_v\ :=
    \widehat{abc}\), where \(b := v + \mathbf{1}\) and \(a\) and \(c\) are the midpoints
    between \(u\) and its two adjacent points in \(\Gamma_v\) <d-footnote>Additionally
    considering \((x_v+1, 1)\) and \((1, y_v+1)\) as adjacent points for the respective edge
    cases of \(u = (x_v, 1)\) and \(u = (1, y_v)\).</d-footnote>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If \(x_u \gt 1\) and \(y_u = 1\), then \(a = (x_u - 0.5, 1)\) and \(c = (x_u + 0.5,
      1)\).
    </li>
    <li>
      Likewise, if \(x_u = 1\) and \(y_u \gt 1\), then \(a = (1, y_u - 0.5)\) and \(c = (1,
      y_u + 0.5)\).
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, if \(x_u = y_u = 1\), then \(a = (1.5, 1)\) and \(c = (1, 1.5)\).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The second factor mitigates against axis-parallel anisotropy by assigning greater
    importance to vertex \(u\) when the line between \(u\) and \(v\) is closer to
    axis-parallel, and is defined as
  </p>

  $$\alpha^u_v := \frac{\max{(x_v - x_u, y_v - y_u}) + 1}{\min{(x_v - x_u, y_v - y_u)} + 1}_.$$

  <p>
  Putting it all together, we have

  $$L^\Gamma_i(v) := \sum_{u_\in \Gamma_v}{\theta^u_v \cdot \alpha^u_v \cdot L^u_i(v)}.$$

  <p>
    As with the \(\mathbf{1}\)-growth heuristic, the graph produced by \(\Gamma\)-growth is
    deterministically generated yet aperiodic. It has a rather more complex structure,
    however, reminiscent of the patterns produced by
    <a href=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule30.html>well-known cellular automata</a>.

  <p>
    So far we have only considered the determination of the diagonal edges, corresponding to
    line segments paralleling \(x=y\). We must also specify how the antidiagonals edges,
    paralleling \(x=-y\), are determined. There are various possibilities that one could try,
    but perhaps the simplest, and the one chosen here, is to simply flip the diagonals (in
    their bit matrix representation) along the first axis. That is to say, an antidiagonal
    edge exists between the vertices \((x+1, y)\) and \((x, y+1)\) iff a diagonal
    edge exists between the vertices \((n - x, y)\) and \((n - x +1, y+1)\).
    <d-footnote>
      While the resulting graphs are technically non-planar, an equivalent planar graph may
      be obtained, if desired, by simply doubling the Eugrid so that e.g.
      <br>
      <img alt="Little X" src="figures/little_x.svg" style="width: 10%;">
      <br>
      is replaced by

    Now we can at last make lovely circles, like so:

  <p>
    At this point you might be getting a bit uncomfortable with developing and evaluating a
    discrete model of the Euclidean plane by comparing pictures of vaguely circular blobs.
    Fortunately, these sorts of models are well-suited to quantitative analysis, which we
    will turn to in the next section.
  </p>

  <h2>Quantitative Analysis</h2>

  <p>
    Farr and Fink<d-cite bibtex-key="Farr_2019"></d-cite> propose three tests for discrete
    models aiming to capture Euclidean geometry. The tests were proposed for models of the
    2-sphere, which Eugrids are not. It is nonetheless fairly straightforward to adapt them
    to our setting, bearing in mind that the results obtained thereby will not be quite
    apples-to-apples comparable with the original metrics.
  </p>

  <h3>Hausdorff dimension</h3>

  <p>
    As defined by <d-cite bibtex-key="Farr_2019"></d-cite> this test measures the statistical
    distribution of vertex eccentricity <d-footnote>The eccentricity of a vertex is the
    greatest distance between it and any other vertex.</d-footnote> as the size of the graph
    increases, in comparison to the distribution that one would expect based on Euclidean
    distances. In particular we consider the distribution over random \(v_\in V\) of the
    graph eccentricity

    $$\epsilon_G(v) := \max_{u_\in V}d_G(u, v)$$

    in comparison to the Euclidean eccentricity

    $$\epsilon_2(v) := \max_{u_\in V}d_2(u, v).$$
  </p>

  <p>For comparing Eugrids of different orders \(n\) we will consider the distribution of

    $$H_G(v) := \frac{\epsilon_G(v) - \epsilon_2(v)}{\sqrt{n}}_.$$

    In particular, we will wish to demonstrate that \(E[H_G]\) and \(SD[H_G]\) both converge
    to zero as \(n\) increases. The choice of \(\sqrt{n}\) as the denominator is
    admittedly debatable and somewhat subjective. The argument is that we are willing to
    address a certain degree of discrepancy by simply constructing a larger graph, but not
    impractically so.

  <p>
    Here, and in the subsequent experiments with random Eugrids, \(p\) is selected using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent%27s_method">Brent&apos;s method</a> to
    minimize the square of the mean of \(H_G\). Nonetheless the standard deviation diverges,
    and we can see that random Eugrids fail the Hausdorff dimension test.

  <p>
    \(\Gamma\)-Eugrids show a small bias upwards (i.e. graph eccentricity tends to be greater
    that Euclidean eccentricity), but on the whole do quite well here.

  <h3>Geodesic confinement</h3>

  <p>
    The number of vertices \(N_{geo}\) in the geodesics (shortest paths) between vertices can
    be easily seen to grow quadratically as a function of distance for graphs corresponding
    to taxicab and chessboard distances; i.e.

    $$N_{geo}(u, v) \propto d_G(u, v)^2.$$

    Farr and Fink <d-cite bibtex-key="Farr_2019"></d-cite> show that this property holds more
    generally, for all doubly-periodic planar graphs. Graphs that exhibit quadratic growth in
    \(N_{geo}\) with distance are unsuitable as models of Euclidean geometry, which requires
    straight lines. In an ideal discrete model of the Euclidean plane, \(N_{geo}\) ought to
    scale linearly with distance, or at least converge to scale according to some exponent
    \(\gamma < 2\). Following <d-cite bibtex-key="Farr_2019"></d-cite> we can quantify the
    degree of geodesic confinement by estimating \(\gamma\) such that

    $$N_{geo}(u, v) \propto d_G(u, v)^\gamma.$$

  <p>
    \(\Gamma\)-Eugrids fail geodesic confinement, and badly at that. Sit tight for now, a fix
    will be forthcoming in the sequel.
  </p>

  <h3>Pythagorean theorem</h3>


  <p>
    If ABC is an equilateral triangle with mid-point M halfway between A and B, then \(d_2(M,
    C) / d_2(A, B) = \sqrt{3} / 2\). We can test this empirically by investigating

    $$T_G(u, v, w, m) := d_G(m, w) / d_G(u, v) - \sqrt{3} / 2$$

    for random equidistant vertices \(u, v, w\) where \(m\) is a vertex midway between \(u\)
    and \(v\). As with \(H_G\), we would like to see \(E[T_G]\) and \(SD[T_G]\) both converge
    to zero as \(n\) increases.
  </p>

    <img alt="T_G for random Eugrids" src="figures/rand_tg.svg" style="width: 90%;">

  <p>
    Random Eugrids appear to pass the Pythagorean theorem test.

      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    \(\Gamma\)-Eugrids are even better, with the standard deviation dropping down quite
    rapidly as the graph size increases.
  </p>

  <h3>Axis anisotropy</h3>

  <p>
    We propose a novel fourth test, specifically for Eugrids. We consider the distribution of
    \(A_G(u, v, w, m)\) which is calculated using the same formula as \(T_G\) but with a
    different sampling distribution over vertices. Specifically, we constrain the sampling of
    \(v\) conditional on \(u\) to satisfy \(x_v = x_u \lor y_v = y_u\). In other words, \(u\)
    must be reachable from \(v\) by moving in one of the four cardinal directions.
  </p>

  <p>
    As above, we would like to see \(E[A_G]\) and \(SD[A_G]\) both converge to zero as \(n\)
    increases.

    \(E[A_G]\) for random Eugrids converges to zero, but \(SD[A_G]\) does not.

  <p>
    \(\Gamma\)-Eugrids demonstrate axis anisotropy that decreases as the size of the graph
    grows.

  <h2>Infinitesimally Disordered Distances: Hacking Geodesic Confinement</h2>

  <figure class="l-body" style="margin-left: 10%;">
    <img alt="Failed geodesic confinement"
	 src="figures/geodesic_fail.png" style="width: 80%;">
    <figcaption style="width: 80%;">
      An extreme case of failed geodesic confinement of a \(\Gamma\)-Eugrid. Endpoints are
      colored gray, other vertices in geodesics are colored black.
      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Why do \(\Gamma\)-Eugrids fail geodesic confinement so badly? Recall that the diagonals
    are aperiodic, so the negative results
    of <d-cite bibtex-key="Fritz_2013,Farr_2019"></d-cite> do not, strictly speaking, apply.
    Perhaps the presence of a regular background grid nonetheless somehow leads to a blowup
    in the number of shortest paths? All that is certain here is that an elegant solution
    remains elusive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus far we have assumed an unweighted graph, where the diagonal edge length equals the
    length of horizontal and vertical edges. Let&apos;s try something else:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The “unit length” of horizontal and vertical edges shall be \((1, 0)\).
    </li>
    <li>
      The length of every diagonal edge shall be \((1, x)\), where \(x\) is drawn uniformly
      at random from \(\{1, 2 \ldots 255\}\).
    </li>
    <li>
      Distances are summed elementwise; if \(d_G(u, v) = (l_1, \Delta_1)\) and \(d_G(v, w) =
      (l_2, \Delta_2)\) and \(v\) is on a shortest path between \(u\) and \(w\), then
      \(d_G(u, w) = (l_1 + l_2, \Delta_1 + \Delta_2)\).
    </li>
    <li>Distances and are compared
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order">lexicographically</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <figure class="l-body" style="margin-left: 10%;">
    <img alt="Successful geodesic confinement"
	 src="figures/geodesic_win.png" style="width: 80%;">
    <figcaption style="width: 80%;">

      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This approach works, but can be fairly characterized as a hack. By construction, the only
    test metric affected by infinitesimally disordered distances is geodesic confinement.

  <h2>Origins and Outlook</h2>

  <p>
    I was showing my son how to make a glider
    in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway&apos;s Game of
    Life</a>, and mentioned in passing that gliders could only move in four different
    directions<d-footnote>There are patterns that move in
    <a href=https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Sir_Robin>other directions</a> of course, but every
    pattern has a particular set of four different directions that it can move
    in.</d-footnote>. This reminded me that we do not appear to live inside of a vast
    cellular automaton or similar, and to wonder anew why not. Under reasonable
    assumptions<d-cite bibtex-key="Schmidhuber_1997"></d-cite>, we apparently ought to.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most readily apparent discrepancy between our observations and the cellular style of
    computation is of course isotropy; a secondary discrepancy is the apparent randomness
    <d-cite bibtex-key="Schmidhuber_2006"></d-cite> of certain experimental outcomes.  This
    led me to wonder how far I could get towards isotropic Euclidean space, in a setting
    reminiscent of the Game of Life, with a two-dimensional square grid, unweighted graph
    distance, and strict determinism.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would say that I got pretty far, all things considered, but not all the way. In terms
    of the empirical results, my failure to achieve proper geodesic confinement without
    abandoning both unweighted graph distance, <i>and</i> strict determinism, is of course
    both glaring and galling. I am also disappointed on the theoretical side by my failure to
    make any progress towards characterizing the emergence of approximately Euclidean
    space from lower-level processes, as <d-cite bibtex-key="Egan_2002,Farr_2019">
    </d-cite> have done. The \(\Gamma\)-Eugrid heuristic is defined <i>in terms</i> of the
    Euclidean metric.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the positive side, the approach is quite nice computationally and, with the
    introduction of infinitesimally disordered distances, all metrics show a discrete model
    of the Euclidean plane that becomes increasingly accurate as the graph grows. The circles
    are pretty.
